#Object Oriented Programming in Python
#Class and Objects
# Think of a railway form as a template. It has spaces for your name, age, gender, and destination.
# When you fill out the form, you're making a specific instance of that template.
# Your details, like your name being John Doe, age 30, gender male, and destination New York, are what make up that instance.
# So, the form is like the class, and the filled-out form is like an object.
